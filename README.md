# Linear Regression Model

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Linear Regression** model for predictive analysis. The model is trained to establish a linear relationship between input features and target variables, commonly used for predicting continuous outcomes.  
It serves as an introduction to machine learning by showcasing the foundational concept of fitting a straight line to the data.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

- **Python 3.x**
- **VSCode (or any code editor)**
- **pip (Python package manager)**

These tools will allow you to set up and run the Python environment necessary for the linear regression model.
